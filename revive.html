        <p>REVIVE is a documentary with the topic of Metacreation Lab for Creative AI. Before starting shooting, our team firstly confirmed the content and the moodboard.
          We aim to show how creative AI is applied in artistic practices, what is visualized music looks like, and the processes about create super-human musicians with artificial intelligence.
          Considering this topic is about technology, we would create a sense of high-tech and aesthetics to audience. </p>
        <p>The filming has two main parts, one is interview, one is rehearsal. The team prepared all interview questions in advance and send them to interviewee.
          During the interview process, we set two camera position, both work at the same time so that we can have more interesting shots in editing.
          Shooting rehearsal is to help audience understand what REVIVE is in visual ways. </p>
        <p>Post-Production is the most difficult part, which required us to consider the color scheme, shot transition, text animation and so on. </p>
